      Release: 2.0.1 (May. 11th, 1998)
Compatibility: BeOS R3 for PowerPC and Intel
     Location: contrib/add-ons/translators
  Description: ZX Spectrum SCREEN$ translator add-on
        Notes: Public domain. Source included.


ZXTranslator is a translator add-on for reading Sinclair ZX Spectrum
SCREEN$ pictures. I've included a few examples pictures for you to try.
The code is based on my ZX Datatype for the Amiga.


The identification process of ZXTranslator is a bit lame. It is purely
based on the file length. ZXTranslator recognises the following file
formats:

 - Raw SCREEN$ image. Length is 6912 bytes.
 - SCREEN$ file saved with the ZX Interface 1. Length is 6921 bytes.
 - SCREEN$ file in the ZX82 (Amiga Speculator) format. Only uncompressed
   (length is 6924 bytes) is supported.
 - SCREEN$ file saved on the +D and ported to the Amiga using ReadPlusD.
   Length is 7396 bytes.


Installation

First rename the correct version for your machine to 'ZXTranslator'.

  The file ending in '_ppc' is the PowerPC (BeBox and Macintosh) version.
  The file ending in '_x86' is the Intel x86 (Pentium PC) version.

Then copy the file to the folder '/boot/home/config/add-ons/Translators'.
